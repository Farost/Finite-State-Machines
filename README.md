# Finite-State-Machines
A program that: 
1. Builds left and right regular grammars 0::=B, 1A::=C, As::=0, 0B::=D, 1B::=B, Bs::=0, 0C::=C, 1C::=D, Cs::=0, 0D::=D, 1D::=D, Ds::=1. 
2. Builds FSM for the following language: each third symbol is "1".
3. Builds FSM for chains and errors, which represent integer identifiers from Fortran beginning with I, J, K, L, M and N.
